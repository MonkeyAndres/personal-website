### CoopStories (2023) 

Write stories with friends. You start the story and then your friends continue it. The catch is that your friends can only see the last paragraph you wrote. Give it a try, it's more fun than it sounds!

### Advent of Code (2022) 
Another year of AoC. This time the solutions were in Go. Such an amazing language! I loved the simplicity, Go code is super easy to read and understand. I dropped out because of lack of time.

### Rabbit Kata (2022)
Another kata. This time I copied the kata from a book I was reading.

### Crazy Ranges Kata (2022)
Kata to practice TDD. I developed this kata for an old company I used to work for. The kata is about generating ranges from a list of numbers. 

My former colleagues loved the kata and we all had a lot of fun solving it.

### Adventure Book (2022)
Superior FP final project. Diary-like app for documenting your adventures. I planned on using this app for my personal adventures. However with time I transitioned into another way of journaling.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/adventure-book)

### Advent of Code (2021)
Another year of Advent of Code. This time I chose to solve the exercises using Elixir. I didn't get far because of my job, but I'm happy with the progress I made. Elixir is a beautiful language, and I'm looking forward to using it more in the future.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/aoc-2021)

### Rust Rover (2021)
Implementation of the Mars Rover problem in Rust. I started this project to learn Rust. Overall, I liked the language for its robustness and type system. It opened my mind to new concepts like ownership, borrowing, pattern matching, and lifetimes.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/rust-rover)

### Advent of Code (2020)
Second year of Advent of Code. This time I solved the exercises using TypeScript. I got further than the previous year [16/25], but I couldn't finish the challenge. I'm happy with the progress I made.

I learned a lot of "type-acrobatics" with TypeScript. Quite fun!

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/aoc-2020)

### Terapia Solidaria (2020)
In the middle of the pandemic, some friends and I started a project to help people. The project was a website where people could find therapists and book appointments. The project got good traction in my city.

Thanks to all the psychologists that volunteered to help people in need. You are the real heroes.

### WhatsApp Chat Viewer (2020)
Small app for viewing exported WhatsApp chats. By this time I changed my phone and I wanted to keep my old chats. I exported them and I developed this app to visualize them. It was a fun project where I learned about parsing and rendering text (in efficient ways). I also learned about web design and UX.

### Docsify Notebook Template (2020)
Template to create notebooks using Docsify. I created this template for people who wanted to have a nice way to share their notebooks. The template is simple, and the Docsify community liked it.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/docsify-notebooks)

### Math Notebooks (2020)
Collection of all my math notebooks. I started studying math to improve my programming skills. By that time I was dreaming of becoming a ML engineer. Unfortunately I got bored of studying math on my own and I stopped. However, I'm proud of the work I did.

### Redukers (2020)
Reusable Redux atoms. Provides composable data structures in form of a reducer and its accompanying selectors. I developed this library for my job. State management is a hard topic, and I wanted to make it easier for my colleagues. The library was a success and we used it in several projects.

[[Code]](https://github.com/redradix/redukers)

### [F] My functional library (2019)
Collection of functional utils implemented from scratch. This "library" was developed as I solved the Advent of Code 2019. Super fun project. Implementing libraries from scratch is a great way to learn how they work internally.

[[Code]](https://gist.github.com/MonkeyAndres/5c191112b76c23f2406a33cc7ce4d61d)

### Advent of Code (2019)
Advent of Code is a yearly coding challenge that takes place in December. I started the challenge in 2019, but I couldn't finish it. Some of the coding problems were too hard for me. 

By that time, I was getting into functional programming and most of the exercises were solved using that paradigm. 

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/aoc-2019)

### AnimeFLV Scrapper (2018)
I developed a scrapper for the anime website AnimeFLV. It was a fun project where I learned the basics of web scraping. This was my first time publishing a package to NPM. The project was discontinued because AnimeFLV is now protected by Cloudflare.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/animeflv-scrapper)

### IronHack Projects
During my time at IronHack, I developed several projects.

#### Khanapp (2018)
> Khanapp is a platform where you can create khanas that are like gymkhanas composed of challenges, in each khana you select a game area, also select a date in which you want to play (for example a park near to you), and the number of challenges you want your khana to have.
> 
> The challenges are trivial type logical tests and you can select the topic of these and its difficulty when you create a khana.

Final project developed in 2 weeks. By this point, I was already familiar with modern web technologies (MEAN stack). It was super fun and full of new challenges: web sockets, maps, geolocation calculus, P2P connections. Great memories. 

Demo of the project in the [IronHack HackShow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lwl9Z-vcnY).

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/Khanapp)

#### CrazyTrips (2018)
Platform to share and discover trips. This project was also developed in 1 week. This time it was a full-stack project with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Handlebars. It was a good learning experience to understand all the different components that a full-stack project has.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/crazytrips)

#### Daily's Hell (2018)

Bullet-hell game developed in JS and HTML5 Canvas API. It was a super fun project where I learned the basics of game development. At first it was hard to develop the physics and to keep the game optimized (due to the amount of bullets on the screen). However I managed to finish it on time and I'm proud of the result.

The entire game was develop in 1 week.

### AlexioProject (2018)
School management system done with Python and Django. It was a fun project where I learned the basics of web development, databases and Python. The project was never finished, but it was a great learning experience.

This project taught me a lot about data modelling. I spent tons of afternoons after high school thinking about the internals of how a school management system works. Furthermore, I started to dive into complex topics like authentication, permissions, and MVC model.

[[Code]](https://github.com/MonkeyAndres/AlexioProject)

### MyNotebooks (2017)
Collection of notebooks (in Spanish) from where I was learning basic programming. The notebooks are incomplete. It's a good memory of my beginnings in the software world.

Notebooks: Git, Java 8, C & C++.
