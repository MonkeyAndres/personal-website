Yesterday in the Effective Altruism fellowship, we watched part of the movie "Dominion". Despite only watching 23 minutes, the movie stirred something inside of me.

The movie depicted the harsh truth about modern farms. It was shocking to watch how the animals were brutally treated with shameless cruelty. This felt so wrong and unnecessary.

I deeply believe animals deserve humane conditions. After all, they are sentient beings just like we are. Nowadays, these creatures spend the majority of their lives in pain. This is deeply tragic and I feel sorry for them.

On my way home, I felt the need to think of something that would align my actions with my new moral beliefs. The first idea that came to mind was veganism. To most, this would be the default way to proceed when you find out about this harsh reality. For me, this was not an option. I find the vegan regimen too strict. In the past, I had a hard time sticking with rigid rules and routines.

After negotiating with myself, I came up with what I called the "plants-first diet". In short, I'm choosing to prioritize plant foods over animal alternatives. As simple as that, no rigid rules whatsoever. Eating animals is not forbidden; instead, it's simply not preferable. To me, this feels like a "good enough" compromise between enacting my beliefs while staying practical.

What does plants-first mean in practice? For me, it means consciously choosing plant-based options whenever they're readily available and satisfying. At home, where I have full control over my meals, I cook mostly vegan dishes. When eating out, I first look at plant-based options on the menu before considering meat dishes. However, I don't stress if the only vegetarian option is a sad salad â€“ in such cases, I might choose a meat dish without guilt. It's about making the better choice when possible, rather than adhering to strict rules.

In general I don't want extra stress and worrying in my life. This is a matter of personal preference. Some people might choose differently, by for example not eating at all. However, this feels too extreme to me. The harm has already been done. I cannot undo the suffering of an animal once it's on my plate.

While this approach might seem like a half-measure compared to veganism, its impact shouldn't be underestimated. Every small reduction adds up over the years. Moreover, flexible approaches like plants-first (also known as reducetarianism) often inspire others through example. These approaches appear more achievable than strict veganism. When friends see me happily choosing plant-based options without the stress of absolute rules, they're more likely to consider similar changes themselves. This ripple effect might actually create more positive change than a strictly individual approach.

Recently I learned about this concept called "moral demandingness". Simply explained, how much are you willing to sacrifice for a moral belief? We can agree that reducing animal suffering is important; however, this doesn't imply we should organize our entire lives to prevent it. Personally, I believe it is wiser to make trade-offs and settle for a "good enough" option that can be maintained with reasonable effort.

This journey has taught me that ethical choices don't have to be all-or-nothing. By adopting the plants-first approach, I strike to make a meaningful difference while maintaining a balanced life. Perhaps this middle ground isn't perfect, but it's sustainable and honest to who I am.
