# :monkey: MonkeyAndres' Blog

Hello, I’m Andres! Welcome to my website! This is my little space in the internet where I share the insight of my researches and my vision of the world.

I’m a very curious person who likes to research from time to time. I experiment with different topics such as nutrition, personal finance, sports, productivity, etc. I enjoy keeping my mind busy with something to do. You can see the projects that I’m currently working on [here](https://monkeyandres.com/now).

Wanna know which tools or hardware do I use? [See here](https://monkeyandres.com/tools).

> The blog is based on the [Astro Micro](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) theme. I'm just too lazy to do this from scratch.
